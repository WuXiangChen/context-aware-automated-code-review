The `MultiplexerNetwork` contains a reference to the `MultiplexerEngine`, the default staked network, the new unstaked network and implements the `Register` method. The `MultiplexerNetwork` can then be passed to the other engines which need a network e.g. the IngestionEngine (instead of passing the standard Network). This Engine seems to mix the functionality of a Network and an Engine and if kept the separate it will be easy to test them."
